# Green-hydrogen
This repository presents 18 experiments, on simulating and optimizing a hydrogen-based power system for residential building, developed in MATLAB. It integrates PV, electrolyzer, fuel cell, hydrogen tank, battery and heat pump. Simulations use public data for energy and power flows, control logic, thermal integration of fuel cell and economic evaluation.

### Notes
- **ControlLogic**: Implements the base control algorithm.  
- **ControlLogicElectrolyzer**: Modified control strategy for experiments involving electrolyzer integration.  
- **data*** folders: Contain 2022 household and heat pump electricity consumption data.  
- **sun2019**: Contains solar irradiation data from ARSO (Slovenian Environment Agency).  
- **Experiment_x**: Each folder contains simulation runs with varying parameters or configurations.
