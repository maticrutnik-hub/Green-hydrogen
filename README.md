# Green-hydrogen
This repository presents 18 experiments on simulating and optimizing a hydrogen-based power system for residential building. It integrates PV, electrolyzer, fuel cell, hydrogen tank, battery and heat pump. Simulations use public data for energy and power flows, control logic, thermal integration of fuel cell and economic evaluation.
